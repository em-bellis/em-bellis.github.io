                <p>Welcome to the website for the Bellis Lab at Arkanasas State University! Our group studies the genetic code to understand organism interactions with abiotic and biotic environments and how these interactions change across space and over time. We take inspiration from evolutionary genomics, spatial ecology, and machine learning and are particularly interested in novel intersections of these fields to address problems relevant to food security and ecosystem health in a rapidly changing climate.</p>

	<p>Most of our research projects focus somehow on understanding interactions, such as:</p>
<h3> Gene <--> Environment </h3>
<p>We working on developing machine learning approaches for improved understanding and prediction of gene-environment interactions, leveraging the extensive genomic and phenotypic resources available for crop systems. This project is not funded yet, but we hope it will be soon!</br></p> 

<h3> Host <--> Symbiont </h3>
<p> Much of our past and ongoing work seeks to understand dynamics of interactions between hosts and their parasite or mutualist partners. We have worked in a broad range of systems, from marine invertebrates (corals & sea anemones) and their symbiotic microbes to parasitic plants (<i>Striga hermonthica</i>) and their cereal hosts (including sorghum, rice, millet, and maize).</p> 
<p> Current projects are leveraging ecological & evolutionary genomic perspectives to inform parasitic weed management in East Africa (Funding: USAID PEER; PI: Steven Runo, Kenyatta University; US-supported partner: Emily Bellis). 	As part of the Arkansas Tallgrass Prairie Collaborative, we are contributing to a study focused on understanding changes in soil microbe communities during prairie restoration and impacts on competition dynamics. (Funding: Arkansas INBRE Collaborative Research Grant & Core Facility Vouchers). </br></p>
	
<h3> Human <--> Computer </h3>
<p>How best can new technologies be leveraged to improve understanding of the natural world and help solve society's challenges? We are exploring this problem in the context of developing computer vision models of UAS-derived remote sensing imagery of rice fields in Arkansas (Funding: U of Arkansas Division of Agriculture). </p>
	<p>As part of the <a href="https://www.astate.edu/news/center-for-no-boundary-thinking-approved-at-a-state">Center for No-Boundary Thinking</a> we contribute to training in AI and machine learning research that prioritizes a human-centered approach and values interactions among disciplines in defining and solving research problems. </br></p>

<h3>Emily Bellis, Ph.D. (PI) </h3>
<p><IMG SRC="em-bellis.github.io/images/Emily_photo.jpg" ALIGN="right" height="118" width="107"/> Emily is from Arkansas and earned a B.S. in Genetics & Biochemistry at Texas A&M University (College Station, TX) in 2010 and a Ph.D. in Integrative Biology in 2017 from Oregon State University (Corvallis, OR), working with Dee Denver. After a short postdoc on population genomics of transposable elements with Sarah Schaack at Reed College (Portland, OR), she worked with Jesse Lasky and Claude dePamphilis at Penn State (State College, PA) as an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Biology through the National Plant Genome Initiative. She joined A-State in late 2019 and is currently an Assistant Professor of Bioinformatics.  In her spare time, she enjoys hiking, knitting, and attempting unsuccessfully to tire out her energetic Border Collie/Aussie, Pascal.</br>

<h3>Adrienne Cooper (Undergraduate Researcher) </h3>
<p> Adrienne is an undergraduate Biology major on the pre-med track. Her research is contributing to the Arkansas Tallgrass Prairie Project, using machine learning based models to characterize the abiotic niche of parasitic plants in the genus <em>Castilleja</em>.</br>

<h3>Arnesha Le'Flore (Undergraduate Researcher) </h3>
<p> Arnesha is an undergraduate Biology major, also contributing to the Arkansas Tallgrass Prairie Project. Her project is using bioinformatic techniques to characterize interactions among soil microbes and dynamics of antibiotic resistance in the environment. </p>

<h3>You?</h3>
<p>We're always recruiting enthusiastic undergraduate students. Please contact Emily for more information on projects of potential mutual interest. </p>  
	
<p>Ph.D. Students are advised through the Molecular Biosciences program and Master's Students are advised through Computer Science. Current funding could support a Graduate Assistantship for one Master's student for two years.  I am also a big advocate of co-advising and happy help students develop applications for independent funding opportunities such as the NSF GRFP.  Please contact Emily to discuss particular research projects you might pursue in the lab to help you progress along your desired career path.</p>
